This section describes how to manage database connections within an application.

[[driver-driver-object]]
== The driver object

A Neo4j client application will require a driver instance in order to provide access to the database.
This driver should be made available to all parts of the application that need to interact with Neo4j.
In languages where <<term-thread-safety, thread safety>> is an issue, the driver can be considered thread-safe.

[TIP]
.A note on lifecycle
--
Applications will typically construct a driver instance on startup and destroy it on exit.
Destroying a driver instance will immediately shut down any connections previously opened via that driver; for drivers that contain a connection pool, the entire pool will be shut down.
--

To construct a driver instance, a <<driver-connection-uris, connection URI>> and <<driver-authentication, authentication information>> must be supplied.
Additional configuration details can be supplied if required.
All of these details are immutable for the lifetime of the driver.
Therefore, if multiple configurations are required (such as when working with multiple database users) then multiple driver instances must be used.

An example of driver construction and destruction can be seen below:

[[driver-connection-uris]]
== Connection URIs

A connection URI identifies a graph database and how to connect to it.
The official Neo4j drivers currently support the following URI schemes and driver object types:

.Available URI schemes
[options="header"]
|===
| URI Scheme     | Driver object type
| bolt           | Direct driver
| bolt+routing   | Routing driver
|===


=== Direct drivers (bolt)

A direct driver is created via a `bolt` URI, for example: `bolt://localhost:7687`.
This kind of driver is used to maintain connections to a single database server and is typically used when working with a single Neo4j instance or when targeting a specific member of a cluster.
Note that a routing driver is generally preferable when working with a Causal Cluster.


[[routing_drivers_bolt_routing]]
=== Routing drivers (bolt+routing)

A routing driver is created via a `bolt+routing` URI, for example: `bolt+routing://graph.example.com:7687`.
The address in the URI must be that of a Core Server.
This kind of driver uses the <<term-bolt-routing-protocol, Bolt Routing Protocol>> and works in tandem with the cluster to route transactions to available cluster members.

=== Routing drivers with routing context

Routing drivers with routing context are an available option when using drivers of version 1.3 or above together with a Neo4j Causal Cluster of version 3.2 or above.
In such a setup, a routing driver can include a preferred routing context via the query part of the `bolt+routing` URI.

In the standard Neo4j configuration, routing contexts are defined on the server side by means of _server policies_.
Thus the driver communicates the routing context to the cluster in the form of a server policy.
It then obtains refined routing information back from the cluster, based on the server policy.

The address in the URI of a routing driver with routing context must be that of a Core Server.

.Configure a routing driver with routing context
====
This example will assume that Neo4j has been configured for server policies as described in <<operations-manual#multi-dc-load-balancing, Neo4j Operations Manual -> Load balancing for multi-data center systems>>.
In particular, a server policy called `europe` has been defined.
Additionally, we have a server `neo01.graph.example.com` to which we wish to direct the driver.

This URI will use the server policy `europe`:

`bolt+routing://neo01.graph.example.com?policy=europe`
====

[NOTE]
.Server-side configuration to enable Routing drivers with routing context
====
A prerequisite for using a Routing driver with routing context is that the Neo4j database is operated on a <<operations-manual#clustering, Causal Cluster>> with the <<operations-manual#multi-dc, Multi-data center licensing option>> enabled.
Additionally, the routing contexts must be defined within the cluster as routing _policies_.
For details on how to configure multi-data center routing policies for a Causal Cluster, please refer to <<operations-manual#multi-dc-load-balancing, Operations Manual -> Causal Clustering>>.
====


=== Cluster bootstrap address resolution

Drivers have the ability to intercept cluster bootstrap address resolution.
This is generally performed by a routing driver on construction or after complete contact has been lost with a cluster.
This hook can be useful to augment regular DNS resolution and can be used to initialize a routing driver with multiple server addresses.

The intercept hook is provided as a driver configuration option and takes the form of a callback function that accepts a single input address and yields or returns multiple output addresses.
This function may hard code the output addresses or may draw them from another configuration source, as required.
Output addresses can contain host names or IP addresses and are forwarded to the connection pool as initial routers.

The example below shows how to expand a single address into multiple (hard coded) output addresses:

[[driver-authentication]]
== Authentication

Authentication details are provided as an auth token which contains the user names, passwords or other credentials required to access the database.
Neo4j supports multiple authentication standards but uses basic authentication by default.


[[driver-authentication-basic]]
=== Basic authentication

The basic authentication scheme is backed by a password file stored within the server and requires applications to provide a user name and password.
For this, use the basic auth helper:

[.tabbed-example]

[NOTE]
--
The basic authentication scheme can also be used to authenticate against an LDAP server.

=== Kerberos authentication

The Kerberos authentication scheme provides a simple way to create a Kerberos authentication token with a base64 encoded server authentication ticket.
The best way to create a Kerberos authentication token is shown below:

[NOTE]
--
The Kerberos authentication token can only be understood by the server if the server has the link:{kerberos-add-on-base-uri}[Kerberos Add-on] installed.
--


[[driver-authentication-custom]]
=== Custom authentication

For advanced deployments, where a custom security provider has been built, the custom authentication helper can be used.

== Configuration


[[driver-configuration-encryption]]
=== Encryption

TLS encryption is enabled for all connections by default.

[NOTE]
====
Please note that if you are using a Neo4j driver with Neo4j Aura, in addition to the default value of enabled encryption, you must also enable `TRUST_SYSTEM_CA_SIGNED_CERTIFICATES`.
====

You can disable encryption through configuration, as follows:

[.tabbed-example]
.Unencrypted

======
[source, csharp]

----
======

[.include-with-python]
======
[source, python]
----
include::{python-examples}/config_unencrypted_example.py[tags=config-unencrypted]
----
======
====

The server can be modified to require encryption for all connections.
Please see the <<operations-manual#connectors, Operations Manual -> Configure Neo4j connectors>> for more information.

An attempt to connect to a server using an encryption setting not allowed by that server will result in a <<driver-service-unavailable, _Service unavailable_>> status.


[[driver-configuration-trust]]
=== Trust

During a TLS handshake, the server provides a certificate to the client application.
The application can choose to accept or reject this certificate based on one of the following trust strategies:

.Trust strategies
[options="header"]
|===
| Trust strategy                        | Description
| `TRUST_ALL_CERTIFICATES` (default)    | Accept any certificate provided by the server, regardless of CA chain.
| `TRUST_CUSTOM_CA_SIGNED_CERTIFICATES` | Accept any certificate that can be verified against a custom CA.
| `TRUST_SYSTEM_CA_SIGNED_CERTIFICATES` | Accept any certificate that can be verified against the system store.
|===

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication[Server Name Indication (SNI)] is enabled by default, allowing proxy middleware to route encrypted Bolt connections to the correct backend server.

[[driver-config-connection-pool-management]]
=== Connection pool management

The driver maintains a pool of connections.
The pooled connections are reused by sessions and transactions to avoid the overhead added by establishing new connections for every query.
The connection pool always starts up empty.
New connections are created on demand by sessions and transactions.
When a session or a transaction is done with its execution, the connection will be returned to the pool to be reused.

Application users can tune connection pool settings to configure the driver for different use cases based on client performance requirements and database resource consumption limits.

Detailed descriptions of connection pool settings available via driver configuration are listed below:

`MaxConnectionLifetime`::
Pooled connections older than this threshold will be closed and removed from the pool.
The actual removal happens during connection acquisition so that the new session returned is never backed by an old connection.
Setting this option to a low value will cause a high connection churn, and can result in a performance drop.
It is recommended to pick a value smaller than the maximum lifetime exposed by the surrounding system infrastructure (such as operating system, router, load balancer, proxy and firewall).
Negative values result in lifetime not being checked.
+
Default value: 1h.

`MaxConnectionPoolSize`::
This setting defines the maximum total number of connections allowed, per host, to be managed by the connection pool.
In other words, for a direct driver, this sets the maximum number of connections towards a single database server.
For a routing driver this sets the maximum amount of connections per cluster member.
If a session or transaction tries to acquire a connection at a time when the pool size is at its full capacity, it must wait until a free connection is available in the pool or the request to acquire a new connection times out.
The connection acquiring timeout is configured via `ConnectionAcquisitionTimeout`.
+
Default value: This is different for different drivers, but is a number in the order of 100.

`ConnectionAcquisitionTimeout`::
This setting limits the amount of time a session or transaction can spend waiting for a free connection to appear in the pool before throwing an exception.
The exception thrown in this case is `ClientException`.
Timeout only applies when connection pool is at its max capacity.
+
Default value: 1m.

[[driver-configuration-max-retry-time]]
=== Max retry time

To configure retry behavior, supply a value for the maximum time in which to keep attempting retries of transaction functions.
For example:

[.tabbed-example]

Note that the time specified here does not take into account the running time of the unit of work itself, merely a limit after which retries will no longer be attempted.


[[driver-service-unavailable]]
== Service unavailable

A Service unavailable status will be signalled when the driver is no longer able to establish communication with the server, even after retries.
Encountering this condition usually indicates a fundamental networking or database problem.
Applications should be designed to cater for this eventuality.
