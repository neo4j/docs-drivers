[[driver-client-applications]]
= Client applications

[abstract]
--
This section describes how to manage database connections within an application.
--


[[driver-driver-object]]
== The Driver object

Neo4j client applications require a Driver object which, from a data access perspective, forms the backbone of the application.
It is through this object that all Neo4j interaction is carried out, and it should therefore be made available to all parts of the application that require data access.
In languages where <<term-thread-safety, thread safety>> is an issue, this Driver object can be considered thread-safe.


[TIP]
.A note on lifecycle
--
Applications will typically construct a Driver object on startup and destroy it on exit.
Destroying a Driver object will immediately shut down any connections previously opened via that driver, by closing the associated connection pool.
This will have the consequence of rolling back any open transactions, and closing any unconsumed results.
--

To construct a driver instance, a <<driver-connection-uris, connection URI>> and <<driver-authentication, authentication information>> must be supplied.
Additional configuration details can be supplied if required.
All of these details are immutable for the lifetime of the Driver.
Therefore, if multiple configurations are required (such as when working with multiple database users) then multiple Driver instances must be used.

[[driver-connection-uris]]
== Connection URIs

Connection URIs are typically formed according to the following pattern:

----
neo4j://<HOST>:<PORT>[?<ROUTING_CONTEXT>]
----

This targets a routed Neo4j service that may be fulfilled by either a cluster or a single instance.
The `HOST` and `PORT` values contain a logical hostname and port number targeting the entry point to the Neo4j service (e.g. `neo4j://graph.example.com:7687`).
In a clustered environment, the URI address will resolve to one of more of the core members; for standalone installations, this will simply point to that server address.
The `ROUTING_CONTEXT` option allows for customization of the routing table and is discussed in more detail in <<driver-routing-context>>.

An alternative URI form, using the `bolt` URI scheme (e.g. `bolt://graph.example.com:7687`), can be used when a single point-to-point connection is required.
This variant is useful for the subset client applications (such as admin tooling) that need to be aware of individual servers, as opposed to those which require a highly available database service.

----
bolt://<HOST>:<PORT>
----
[NOTE]
Neo4j 3.x did not provide a routing table in single instance mode and therefore you should use a `bolt://` URI if targeting an older, non-clustered server.

=== Initial address resolution

The address provided in a `neo4j://` URI is used for initial and fallback communication only.
This communication occurs to bootstrap the routing table, through which all subsequent communication is carried out.
Fallback occurs when the driver is unable to contact any of the addresses held in the routing table.
The initial address is once again reused to bootstrap the system.

Several options are available for providing this initial logical-to-physical host resolution.
These include regular DNS, custom middleware such as a load balancer, and the Driver object _resolver function_, all of which are described in the following sections.

==== DNS resolution

DNS resolution is the default, and always-available option.
As it is possible to configure DNS to resolve a single host name down to multiple IP addresses, this can be used to expose all core server IP addresses under a single host name.

image::dns-resolution.png[title="Initial address resolution over DNS", role="middle"]

==== Custom middleware

Middleware, such as a load balancer, can be used to group the core servers under a single public address.

image::custom-middleware.png[title="Initial address resolution using custom middleware"]

[[driver-resolver-function]]
==== Resolver function

Neo4j drivers also present an address resolution intercept hook called the _resolver function_.
This takes the form of a callback function that accepts a single input address and returns multiple output addresses.
The function may hard code the output addresses or may draw them from another configuration source, as required.

image::resolver-function.png[title="Initial address resolution using resolver function"]

The example below shows how to expand a single address into multiple (hard-coded) output addresses:

=== Routing table

The routing table acts like the glue between the driver connectivity layer and the database surface.
This table contains a list of server addresses, grouped as readers and writers, and is refreshed automatically by the driver as required.

The driver does not expose any API to work directly with the routing table, but it can sometimes be useful to explore when troubleshooting a system.

[[driver-routing-context]]
=== Routing context

A routing context can be included as the query part of a `neo4j://` URI. Routing contexts are defined by means of server policies and allow customization of the contents of the routing table.

.Configure a routing driver with routing context
====
This example will assume that Neo4j has been configured for server policies as described in <<operations-manual#multi-dc-load-balancing, Neo4j Operations Manual -> Load balancing for multi-data center systems>>.
In particular, a server policy called `europe` has been defined.
Additionally, we have a server `neo01.graph.example.com` to which we wish to direct the driver.

This URI will use the server policy `europe`:

`neo4j://neo01.graph.example.com?policy=europe`
====

[NOTE]
.Server-side configuration to enable routing drivers with routing context
====
A prerequisite for using a routing driver with routing context is that the Neo4j database is operated on a <<operations-manual#clustering, Causal Cluster>> with the <<operations-manual#multi-dc, Multi-data center licensing option>> enabled.
Additionally, the routing contexts must be defined within the cluster as routing _policies_.
For details on how to configure multi-data center routing policies for a Causal Cluster, please refer to <<operations-manual#multi-dc-load-balancing, Operations Manual -> Causal Clustering>>.

[[driver-authentication]]
== Authentication

Authentication details are provided as an auth token which contains the user names, passwords or other credentials required to access the database.
Neo4j supports multiple authentication standards but uses basic authentication by default.


[[driver-authentication-basic]]
=== Basic authentication

The basic authentication scheme is backed by a password file stored within the server and requires applications to provide a user name and password.
For this, use the basic auth helper:

The basic authentication scheme can also be used to authenticate against an LDAP server.
--

=== Kerberos authentication

The Kerberos authentication scheme provides a simple way to create a Kerberos authentication token with a base64 encoded server authentication ticket.
The best way to create a Kerberos authentication token is shown below:

[[driver-authentication-custom]]
=== Custom authentication

For advanced deployments, where a custom security provider has been built, the custom authentication helper can be used.

[[driver-security]]
== Security


[CAUTION]
There are significant changes to security settings between Neo4j 3.x and Neo4j 4.x.
Please consider the information in this section before upgrading from a previous version.
The <<migration-guide#migration-guide, Migration Guide>> is also a good source of information about changes in functionality.

Starting with Neo4j 4.0, client-server communication uses only *unencrypted local* connections by default.
This is a change from previous versions, which switched on encryption by default, but generated a self-signed certificate out of the box.

When a full certificate is installed, and encryption is enabled on the driver, full certificate checks are carried out (refer to <<operations-manual#ssl-framework, Operations Manual -> SSL framework >>).
Full certificates provide better overall security than self-signed certificates as they include a complete chain of trust back to a root certificate authority.

[NOTE]
https://neo4j.com/aura/[Neo4j Aura] is a secure hosted service backed by full certificates signed by a root certificate authority.
To connect to Neo4j Aura, driver users must enable encryption and the complete set of certificate checks (the latter of which are enabled by default).

.Changes in default security settings between 3.x and 4.x
[options="header"]
|===
| Setting | Neo4j 4.x | Neo4j 3.x (Drivers 1.x)
| Bundled certificate | none | auto-generated, self-signed
| Driver encryption   | off  | on
| Bolt interface      | localhost |localhost
| Certificate expiry check  | on  |on
| Certificate CA check  | on  | off
| Certificate hostname check  | on  | off
|===


[[driver-configuration]]
== Configuration

`ConnectionAcquisitionTimeout`::

The maximum amount of time a session will wait when requesting a connection from the connection pool.
For connection pools where all connections are currently being used and the `MaxConnectionPoolSize` limit has been reached, a session will wait this duration for a connection to be made available.
Since the process of acquiring a connection may involve creating a new connection, ensure that the value of this configuration is higher than the configured `ConnectionTimeout`.
+
Setting a low value will allow for transactions to “fail fast” when all connections in the pool have been acquired by other transactions.
Setting a higher value will result in these transactions being queued, increasing the chances of eventually acquiring a connection at the cost of longer time to receive feedback on failure.
Finding an optimal value may require an element of experimentation, taking into consideration the expected levels of parallelism within your application as well as the `MaxConnectionPoolSize.
Default: 60 seconds

====

`ConnectionTimeout`::

The maximum amount of time to wait for a TCP connection to be established.
Connections are only created when a session requires one unless there is an available connection in the connection pool.
The driver maintains a pool of open connections which can be loaned to a session when one is available.
If a connection is not available, then an attempt to create a new connection (provided the `MaxConnectionPoolSize` limit has not been reached) is made with this configuration option, providing the maximum amount of time to wait for the connection to be established.
+
In environments with high latency and high occurrences of connection timeouts it is recommended to configure a higher value.
For lower latency environments and quicker feedback on potential network issues configure with a lower value.
Default: 30 seconds

Specify a custom server address resolver used by the routing driver to resolve the initial address used to create the driver. See <<driver-resolver-function>> for more details.

Default: None

====

`MaxConnectionLifetime`::

The maximum duration the driver will keep a connection for before being removed from the pool.
Note that while the driver will respect this value, it is possible that the network environment will close connections inside this lifetime.
This is beyond the control of the driver.
The check on the connection’s lifetime happens when a session requires a connection.
If the available connection’s lifetime is over this limit it is closed and a new connection is created, added to the pool and returned to the requesting session.
Changing this configuration value would be useful in environments where users don’t have full control over the network environment and wish to proactively ensure all connections are ready.
+
Setting this option to a low value will cause a high connection churn rate, and can result in a performance drop.
It is recommended to pick a value smaller than the maximum lifetime exposed by the surrounding system infrastructure (such as operating system, router, load balancer, proxy and firewall).
Negative values result in lifetime not being checked.
Default: 1 hour

`MaxConnectionPoolSize`::

The maximum total number of connections allowed, per host (i.e. cluster nodes), to be managed by the connection pool.
In other words, for a direct driver using the `bolt://` scheme, this sets the maximum number of connections towards a single database server.
For a driver connected to a cluster using the `neo4j://` scheme, this sets the maximum amount of connections per cluster member.
If a session or transaction tries to acquire a connection at a time when the pool size is at its full capacity, it must wait until a free connection is available in the pool or the request to acquire a new connection times out.
The connection acquiring timeout is configured via `ConnectionAcquisitionTimeout`.
+
This configuration option allows you to manage the memory and I/O resources being used by the driver and tuning this option is dependent on these factors, in addition to number of cluster members.
Default: 100 connections (except .NET driver with 500 connections)

`MaxRetryTime`::

The maximum amount of time that a managed transaction will retry for before failing. Queries that are executed within a managed transaction gain the benefit of being retried when a transient error occurs.
When this happens the transaction is retired multiple times up to the `MaxRetryTime`.
+
Configure this option higher in high latency environments or if you are executing many large transactions which could limit the number of times that they are retired and therefore their chance to succeed.
Configure lower in low latency environments and where your workload mainly consists of many smaller transactions.
Failing transactions faster may highlight the reasons behind the transient errors making it easier to fix underlying issues.
Default: 30 seconds

`TrustStrategy`::

Specify how to determine the authenticity of encryption certificates provided by the Neo4j instance that you are connecting to.
There are three choices as to which strategy to use:

* `TRUST_SYSTEM_CA_SIGNED_CERTIFICATES` - Accept any certificate that can be verified against a custom CA.

* `TRUST_CUSTOM_CA_SIGNED_CERTIFICATES` - Accept any certificate that can be verified against the system store.

* `TRUST_ALL_CERTIFICATES` - Accept any certificate provided by the server, regardless of CA chain. *We do not recommend using this setting for production environments.*

+
Default: `TRUST_SYSTEM_CA_SIGNED_CERTIFICATES` (Note - only when encryption is enabled)

Specify whether TCP keep-alive should be enabled. To ensure that the connection between the driver and server is still operational, the TCP layer can periodically send messages to check the connection.

Default value: true
