= Manipulate query results

This section shows how to work with a query's result so as to extract data in the form that is most convenient for your application.


== Result as a list

By default, xref:query-simple.adoc[`Driver.execute_query()`] returns an link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/api.html#neo4j.EagerResult[`EagerResult`] object.
It contains the result records as a list, so it is easy to loop through them *(1)*.
It also contains a xref:result-summary.adoc[summary of execution], with metadata and information about the result *(2)*, and the `keys` available in the returned rows *(3)*.

[source, python]
----
records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query(
    "MATCH (a:Person) RETURN a.name AS name, a.age AS age",
    database_="neo4j",
)
for person in records:  # <1>
    print(person)
    # person.name or person.age are also valid

# Some summary information  <2>
print("Query `{query}` returned {records_count} records in {time} ms.".format(
    query=summary.query, records_count=len(records),
    time=summary.result_available_after
))

print(f"Available keys are {keys}")  # ['name', 'age'] <3>
----


== Transform to pandas DataFrame

The driver can transform the result into a pandas DataFrame.
To achieve this, use the `.execute_query()` keyword argument `result_transformer_` and set it to `neo4j.Result.to_df`.
This method is only available if the `pandas` library is installed.

.Return a DataFrame with two columns (`n`, `m`) and 10 rows
[source, python]
----
import neo4j

pandas_df = driver.execute_query(
    "UNWIND range(1, 10) AS n RETURN n, n+1 as m",
    database_="neo4j",
    result_transformer_=neo4j.Result.to_df
)
print(type(pandas_df))  # <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
----

This transformer accepts two optional arguments:

- `expand` -- If `True`, some data structures in the result will be recursively expanded and flattened. More info in the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/api.html#neo4j.Result.to_df[API documentation].
- `parse_dates` -- If `True`, columns exclusively containing `time.DateTime` objects, `time.Date` objects, or `None`, will be converted to `pandas.Timestamp`.

[NOTE]
If you need to pass parameters to `to_df`, use `lambda` functions: +
`result_transformer_=lambda res: res.to_df(True)`


== Transform to graph

The driver can transform the result into a collection of graph objects.
To achieve this, use the `.execute_query()` keyword argument `result_transformer_` and set it to `neo4j.Result.graph`.
To make the most out of this method, your query should return a graph-like result instead of a single column.
The graph transformer exposes the properties `nodes` and `relationships`, which are set views into xref:data-types#_node[`Node`] and xref:data-types#_relationship[`Relationship`] objects.

You can use the graph format for further processing or to visualize the query result.
An example implementation that uses the `pyvis` library to draw the graph is below.

.Visualize graph result with `pyvis`
[source, python]
----
import pyvis
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
import neo4j


URI = "<URI for Neo4j database>"
AUTH = ("<Username>", "<Password>")


def main():
    with GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH) as driver:
        # Create some friends
        input_list = [("Arthur", "Guinevre"),
                      ("Arthur", "Lancelot"),
                      ("Arthur", "Merlin")]
        driver.execute_query("""
            UNWIND $pairs AS pair
            MERGE (a:Person {name: pair[0]})
            MERGE (a)-[:KNOWS]->(friend:Person {name: pair[1]})
            """, pairs=input_list,
            database_="neo4j",
        )

        # Create a film
        driver.execute_query("""
            MERGE (film:Film {title: $title})
            MERGE (liker:Person {name: $person_name})
            MERGE (liker)-[:LIKES]->(film)
            """, title="Wall-E", person_name="Arthur",
            database_="neo4j",
        )

        # Query to get a graphy result
        graph_result = driver.execute_query("""
            MATCH (a:Person {name: $name})-[r]-(b)
            RETURN a, r, b
            """, name="Arthur",
            result_transformer_=neo4j.Result.graph,
        )

        # Draw graph
        nodes_text_properties = {  # what property to use as text for each node
            "Person": "name",
            "Film": "title",
        }
        visualize_result(graph_result, nodes_text_properties)


def visualize_result(query_graph, nodes_text_properties):
    visual_graph = pyvis.network.Network()

    for node in query_graph.nodes:
        node_label = list(node.labels)[0]
        node_text = node[nodes_text_properties[node_label]]
        visual_graph.add_node(node.element_id, node_text, group=node_label)

    for relationship in query_graph.relationships:
        visual_graph.add_edge(
            relationship.start_node.element_id,
            relationship.end_node.element_id,
            title=relationship.type
        )

    visual_graph.show('network.html', notebook=False)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

== Custom transformers

For more advanded scenarios, you can use the parameter `result_transformer_` to provide a custom function that further manipulates the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/api.html#neo4j.Result[`Result`] object resulting from your query.
A transformer takes a `Result` object and can output any data structure. The transformer's return value is in turn returned by `.execute_query()`.

Inside a transformer function you can use xref:transactionn[any of the `Result` methods].

[WARNING]
A transformer **must not** return the `Result` object itself.
Doing so is roughly equivalent to returning a _pointer_ to the result buffer, which gets invalidated as soon as the query's transaction is over.

.A custom transformer using `single` and `consume`
[source, python]
----
# Get a single record (or an exception) and the summary from a result.
def get_single_person(result):
    record = result.single(strict=True)
    summary = result.consume()
    return record, summary


record, summary = driver.execute_query(
    "MATCH (a:Person {name: $name}) RETURN a.name AS name",
    name="Alice",
    database_="neo4j",
    result_transformer_=get_single_person,
)
print("The query `{query}` returned {record} in {time} ms.".format(
      query=summary.query, record=record, time=summary.result_available_after))
----


.A custom transformer using `fetch` and `peek`
[source, python]
----
# Get exactly 5 records, or an exception.
def exactly_5(result):
    records = result.fetch(5)

    if len(records) != 5:
        raise Exception(f"Expected exactly 5 records, found only {len(records)}.")
    if result.peek():
        raise Exception("Expected exactly 5 records, found more.")

    return records


records = driver.execute_query(
    "MATCH (a:Person) RETURN a.name AS name",
    database_="neo4j",
    result_transformer_=exactly_5,
)
----


////
[source, python]
----
def transformer(result):
    return result

result = driver.execute_query("MATCH (a:Person) RETURN a.name AS name;", result_transformer_=transformer)
print(result)
print(result.single())
----
results in
`neo4j.exceptions.ResultConsumedError: The result is out of scope. The associated transaction has been closed. Results can only be used while the transaction is open.`
on the second print.
