== The Driver Object

include::{common-partial}/client-applications.adoc[tag=object-pt1]

To construct a driver instance, a xref:client-applications.adoc#go-driver-connection-uris[connection URI] and xref:client-applications.adoc#go-driver-authentication[authentication information] must be supplied.

[[go-driver-connection-uris]]
== Connection URIs

include::{common-partial}/client-applications.adoc[tag=uris]

[NOTE]
====
https://neo4j.com/aura/[*Neo4j Aura*] is a *_secure hosted service_* backed by full certificates signed by a root certificate authority.

To connect to *Neo4j Aura*, driver users must *_enable encryption_* and the complete set of certificate checks (the latter of which are enabled by default).

For more information, see xref:client-applications.adoc#go-driver-configuration-examples[Examples] below.

=== Routing table

=== Routing context

include::{common-partial}/client-applications.adoc[tag=routing-context]


[[go-driver-configuration-examples]]
=== Examples

include::{common-partial}/client-applications.adoc[tag=examples-pt1]

In a clustered environment, the URI address will resolve to one of more of the core members; for standalone installations, this will simply point to that server address.
The `ROUTING_CONTEXT` option allows for customization of the routing table and is discussed in more detail in xref:client-applications.adoc#go-driver-routing-context[Routing context].

.Connecting to a service
The tables below illustrate examples of how to connect to a service with routing:

.Neo4j Aura or Neo4j >= 4.x, secured with full certificate
[cols="<15s,<85a"]
|===
| Product
| Neo4j Aura, Neo4j >= 4.x

| Security
| Secured with full certificate

| Code snippet
|
[source, go, indent=0]
----
neo4j.NewDriver("neo4j+s://graph.example.com:7687", auth)
----

| Comments
| This is the default (and only option) for Neo4j Aura.
|===

.Neo4j >= 4.x, unsecured
[cols="<15s,<85a"]
|===
| Product
| Neo4j >= 4.x

| Security
| Unsecured

| Code snippet
|
[source, go, indent=0]
----
neo4j.NewDriver("neo4j://graph.example.com:7687", auth);
----

| Comments
| This is the default for Neo4j >= 4.x series
|===

.Neo4j >= 4.x, secured with self-signed certificate
[cols="<15s,<85a"]
|===
| Product
| Neo4j >= 4.x

| Security
| Secured with self-signed certificate

| Code snippet
|
[source, go, indent=0]
----
neo4j.NewDriver("neo4j+ssc://graph.example.com:7687", auth)

[NOTE]
To connect to a service without routing, you can replace `neo4j` with `bolt`.

`CustomResolver`::

Specify a custom server address resolver used by the routing driver to resolve the initial address used to create the driver.
See xref:client-applications.adoc#go-driver-resolver-function[Resolver function] for more details.

`TrustStrategy`::
+
This is not applicable for the Go driver, as it uses a URI to determine trust strategy.
RootCAs can be used to configure custom CAs.

// `KeepAlive`::
//
// Specify whether TCP keep-alive should be enabled. To ensure that the connection between the driver and server is still operational, the TCP layer can periodically send messages to check the connection.
// +
// *Default:* True
//
// [NOTE]
// ====
// This is currently only configurable in the .NET Driver
