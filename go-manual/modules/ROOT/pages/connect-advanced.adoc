= Advanced connection information

== Connection URI

The driver supports connection to URIs of the form

[source]
----
<SCHEME>://<HOST>[:<PORT>[?policy=<POLICY-NAME>]]
----

- `<SCHEME>` is one among `neo4j`, `neo4j+s`, `neo4j+ssc`, `bolt`, `bolt+s`, `bolt+ssc`.
- `<HOST>` is the host name where the Neo4j server is located.
- `<PORT>` is optional, and denotes the port the <<Bolt>> protocol is available at.
- `<POLICY-NAME>` is an optional _server policy_ name. link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/docs/operations-manual/current/clustering/clustering-advanced/multi-data-center-routing/[Server policies] need to be set up prior to usage.

[NOTE]
Notice that *the driver does not support connection to a nested path*, such as `example.com/neo4j/`.
The server must be reachable from the domain root.


== Connection protocols and security

Communication between the driver and the server is mediated by <<Bolt>>.
The scheme of the server URI determines whether the connection is encrypted and, if so, what type of certificates are accepted.

[options="header", cols="20,40,40"]
|===
|URL scheme
|Encryption
|Comment

|neo4j
|{cross-mark}
|Default for local setups

|neo4j+s
|{check-mark} (only CA-signed certificates)
|Default for Aura

|neo4j+ssc
|{check-mark} (CA- and self-signed certificates)
|
|===

[TIP]
The driver receives a _routing table_ from the server upon successful connection, regardless of whether the instance is a proper cluster environment or a single-machine environment.
The driver's routing behavior works in tandem with link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/clustering/[Neo4j's clustering] by directing read/write transactions to appropriate cluster members.
If you want to target a _specific_ machine, use the `bolt`, `bolt+s`, or `bolt+ssc` URI schemes instead.

The connection scheme to use is not your choice, but is rather determined by the server requirements.
You must know the right server scheme upfront, as no metadata is exposed prior to connection.
If you are unsure, ask the database administrator.

== Authentication methods

=== Basic authentication

The basic authentication scheme relies on traditional username and password.
These can either be the credentials for your local installation, or the ones provided with an Aura instance.

[source, go]
----
driver, err := neo4j.NewDriverWithContext(
    dbUri,
    neo4j.BasicAuth(dbUser, dbPassword, ""))
----

[INFO]
The basic authentication scheme can also be used to authenticate against an LDAP server (Enterprise Edition only).

=== Kerberos authentication

The Kerberos authentication scheme requires a base64-encoded ticket.
It can only be used if the server has the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/kerberos-add-on/current/deployment/[Kerberos Add-on installed].

[source, go]
----
driver, err := neo4j.NewDriverWithContext(dbUri, neo4j.KerberosAuth(ticket))
----

=== Bearer authentication

The bearer authentication scheme requires a base64-encoded token provided by an Identity Provider through Neo4j's link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/sso-integration[Single Sign-On feature].

[source, go]
----
driver, err := neo4j.NewDriverWithContext(dbUri, neo4j.BearerAuth(token))
----

[NOTE]
The bearer authentication scheme requires link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/sso-integration[configuring Single Sign-On on the server].
Once configured, clients can discover Neo4j's configuration through the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/http-api/current/discovery/[Discovery API].

=== Custom authentication

Use the function link:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j#CustomAuth[`CustomAuth`] to log into a server having a custom authentication scheme.

[NOTE]
If authentication is disabled on the server, the `auth` parameter can be omitted entirely.


== Custom address resolver

When creating a `Driver` object, you can specify a _resolver_ function to resolve any addresses the driver receives ahead of DNS resolution.
Your resolver function is called with an link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/api.html#neo4j.Address[`Address`] object and should return an iterable of link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/api.html#neo4j.Address[`Address`] objects (or values that can be used to construct `Address` objects)

In the following example, the connection to `example.com` on port `9999` is resolved to `localhost` on port `7687`:

[source,python]
----
import neo4j


def custom_resolver(socket_address):
    # assert isinstance(socket_address, neo4j.Address)
    if socket_address != ("example.com", 9999):
        raise OSError(f"Unexpected socket address {socket_address!r}")

    # You can return any neo4j.Address object
    yield neo4j.Address(("localhost", 7687))  # IPv4
    yield neo4j.Address(("::1", 7687, 0, 0))  # IPv6
    yield neo4j.Address.parse("localhost:7687")
    yield neo4j.Address.parse("[::1]:7687")

    # or any tuple that can be passed to neo4j.Address(...).
    # This will initially be interpreted as IPv4, but DNS resolution
    # will turn it into IPv6 if appropriate.
    yield "::1", 7687
    # This will be interpreted as IPv6 directly, but DNS resolution will
    # still happen.
    yield "::1", 7687, 0, 0
    yield "127.0.0.1", 7687


driver = neo4j.GraphDatabase.driver("neo4j://example.com:9999",
                                    auth=(user, password),
                                    resolver=custom_resolver)
----
