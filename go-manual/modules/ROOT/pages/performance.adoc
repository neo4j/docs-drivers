[[target-database]]
== Always specify the target database

*Specify the target database on all queries*, either with the xref:query-simple.adoc#_database_selection[`ExecuteQueryWithDatabase()` configuration callback in `ExecuteQuery()`] or with the xref:transactions.adoc#_database_selection[`DatabaseName` configuration parameter when creating new sessions].
If no database is provided, the driver has to send an extra request to the server to figure out what the default database is.
The overhead is minimal for a single query, but becomes significant over hundreds of queries.

[[transactions-cost]]
== Be aware of the cost of transactions

When submitting queries through xref:query-simple.adoc[`ExecuteQuery()`] or through xref:transactions.adoc#managed-transactions[`.ExecuteRead/Write()`], the server automatically wraps them into a <<transaction>>.
This behavior ensures that the database always ends up in a consistent state, regardless of what happens during the execution of a transaction (power outages, software crashes, etc).

Creating a safe execution context around a number of queries yields an overhead that is not present if the driver just shoots queries at the server and hopes they will get through.
The overhead is small, but can add up as the number of queries increases.
For this reason, if your use case values throughput more than data integrity, you may extract further performance by running all queries within a single (auto-commit) transaction.
You do this by creating a session and using `Session.Run()` to run as many queries as needed.

.Privilege throughput over data integrity
[source, go]
----
session := driver.NewSession(ctx, neo4j.SessionConfig{DatabaseName: "neo4j"})
defer session.Close(ctx)
for i := 0; i < 10000; i++ {
    session.Run(ctx, "<QUERY>", nil)
}

    // or session.executeRead/Write() calls
}
----


[[lazy-eager-loading]]
== Don't fetch large result sets all at once

When submitting queries that may result in a lot of records, don't retrieve them all at once.
The Neo4j server can retrieve records in batches and stream the to the driver as they become available.
Lazy-loading a result spreads out network traffic and memory usage.

For convenience, xref:query-simple.adoc[`.ExecuteQuery()`] always retrieves all result records at once (it is what the `Eager` in `EagerResult` stands for).
To lazy-load a result, you have to use xref:transactions.adoc#managed-transactions[`.ExecuteRead/Write()`] (or other forms of manually-handled xref:transactions.adoc[transactions]) and *not* call `.Collect(ctx)` on the result; iterate on it instead.

.Comparison between eager and lazy loading
====

[cols="1a,1a", options="header"]
|===
|Eager loading
|Lazy loading

|
- The server has to read all 250 records from the storage before it can send even the first one to the driver (i.e. it takes more time for the client to receive the first record).
- Before any record is available to the application, the driver has to receive all 250 records.
- The client has to hold in memory all 250 records.

|
- The server reads the first record and sends it to the driver.
- The application can process records as soon as the first record is transferred.
- Waiting time and resource consumption for the remaining records is deferred to when the application requests more records.
- The server's fetch time can be used for client-side processing.
- Resource consumption is bounded by the driver's fetch size.

<1> With lazy loading, the first record is quickly available.
<2> With eager loading, the first record is available ~25 seconds after the query has been submitted (i.e. after the server has retrieved all 250 records).
<3> The total running time is lower with lazy loading, because while the client processes records the server can fetch the next ones.
With lazy loading, the client could also stop requesting records after some condition is met (by calling `.Consume(ctx)` on the `Result`), saving time and resources.

====

[TIP]
====
The driver's link:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j#SessionConfig[fetch size] affects the behavior of lazy loading.
It instructs the server to stream an amount of records equal to the fetch size, and then wait until the client has caught up before retrieving and sending more.

The fetch size allows to bound memory consumption on the client side.
It doesn't always bound memory consumption on the server side though: that depends on the query.
For example, a query with link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/order-by/[`ORDER BY`] requires the whole result set to be loaded into memory for sorting, before records can be streamed to the client.

The lower the fetch size, the more messages client and server have to exchange.
Especially if the server's latency is high, a low fetch size may deteriorate performance.
====

[[read-mode]]
== Route read queries to cluster readers

In a cluster, *route read queries to link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/clustering/introduction/#clustering-secondary-mode[secondary nodes]*. You do this by:

- using the xref:query-simple.adoc#_request_routing[`ExecuteQueryWithReadersRouting()` configuration callback in `ExecuteQuery()`] calls
- using `ExecuteRead()` instead of `ExecuteWrite()` (for managed transactions)
- setting xref:transactions.adoc#_request_routing[`AccessMode: neo4j.AccessModeRead` when creating a new session] (for explicit transactions).

[[indexes]]
== Create indexes

*Create indexes for properties that you often filter against*.

You can create indexes with the `CREATE INDEX` Cypher clause, for both nodes and relationships.

----
// Create an index on Person.name
neo4j.ExecuteQuery(ctx, driver,
    "CREATE INDEX personName FOR (n:Person) ON (n.name)",

[[concurrency]]
== Concurrency

*Use xref:concurrency.adoc[concurrency patterns]*.
This is likely to be more impactful on performance if you parallelize complex and time-consuming queries in your application, but not so much if you run many simple ones.


[[merge]]
== Use `MERGE` for creation only when needed

The Cypher clause link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/current/clauses/merge/[`MERGE`] is convenient for data creation, as it allows to avoid duplicate data when an exact clone of the given pattern exists.
However, it requires the database to run _two_ queries: it first needs to link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/current/clauses/match/[`MATCH`] the pattern, and only then can it link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/current/clauses/create/[`CREATE`] it (if needed).

If you know already that the data you are inserting is new, avoid using `MERGE` and use `CREATE` directly instead -- this practically halves the number of database queries.
