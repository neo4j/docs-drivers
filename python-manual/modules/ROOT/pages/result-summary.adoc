# Explore the query execution summary

After all results coming from a query have been processed, the server ends the transaction by returning a summary of execution.
It comes as a link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/api.html#resultsummary[`ResultSummary`] object, and it contains information among which:

- xref:_query_counters[**Query counters**] -- What changes the query triggered on the server
- xref:_query_execution_plan[**Query execution plan**] -- How the database would execute (or executed) the query
- xref:_notifications[**Notifications**] -- Extra information raised by the server while running the query
- Timing information and query request summary


## Retrieve the execution summary

When running queries with xref:query-simple.adoc[`Driver.execute_query()`], the execution summary is part of the default return object, under the `summary` key.

[source, python]
----
records, result_summary, keys = driver.execute_query("""
    UNWIND ["Alice", "Bob"] AS name
    MERGE (p:Person {name: name})
    """, database_="neo4j",
)
# or result_summary = driver.execute_query('<QUERY>').summary
----

If you are using xref:transactions.adoc[transaction functions], or a xref:transformers.adoc#_custom_transformers[custom transformer] with `Driver.execute_query()`, you can retrieve the query execution summary with the method `Result.consume()`.
**Notice that once you ask for the execution summary, the result stream is exhausted**.
This means that any record which has not yet been processed is not available any longer.

[source, python]
----
def create_people(tx):
    result = tx.run("""
        UNWIND ["Alice", "Bob"] AS name
        MERGE (p:Person {name: name})
    """)
    return result.consume()

with driver.session(database="neo4j") as session:
    result_summary = session.execute_write(create_people)
----


## Query counters

The property `ResultSummary.counters` contains counters for the operations that a query triggered (as a link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/api.html#summarycounters[`SummaryCounters`] object).

.Insert some data and display the query counters
[source, python]
----
summary = driver.execute_query("""
    MERGE (p:Person {name: $name})
    MERGE (p)-[:KNOWS]->(:Person {name: $friend})
    """, name="Mark", friend="Bob",
    database_="neo4j",
).summary
print(summary.counters)
"""
{'_contains_updates': True, 'labels_added': 2, 'relationships_created': 1,
 'nodes_created': 2, 'properties_set': 2}
"""
----

There are two additional boolean properties which act as meta-counters:

- `contains_updates` -- whether the query triggered any write operation on the database on which it ran
- `contains_system_updates` -- whether the query updated the `system` database


## Query execution plan

If you prefix a query with `EXPLAIN`, the server will return the plan it _would_ use to run the query, but will not actually run it.
The plan is then available under the property `ResultSummary.plan`, and contains the list of link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/current/planning-and-tuning/operators/[Cypher operators] that would be used to retrieve the result set.
You may use this information to locate potential bottlenecks or room for performance improvements (for example through the creation of indexes).

[source, python, role=nocollapse]
----
_, summary, _ = driver.execute_query("EXPLAIN MATCH (p {name: $name}) RETURN p", name="Alice")
print(summary.plan['args']['string-representation'])

If you instead prefix a query with the keyword `PROFILE`, the server will return the execution plan it has used to run the query, together with profiler statistics.
This includes the list of operators that were used and additional profiling information about each intermediate step.
The plan is available under the property `ResultSummary.profile`.
Notice that the query is also _run_, so the result object also contains any result records.

[source, python, role=nocollapse]
----
records, summary, _ = driver.execute_query("PROFILE MATCH (p {name: $name}) RETURN p", name="Alice")
print(summary.profile['args']['string-representation'])

## Notifications

The property `ResultSummary.summary_notifications` contains a list of link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/status-codes/current/notifications[notifications coming from the server], if any were raised by the execution of the query.
These include recommendations for performance improvements, warnings about the usage of deprecated features, and other hints about sub-optimal usage of Neo4j.
Each notification comes as a link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/api.html#neo4j.SummaryNotification[`SummaryNotification`] object.

### Filter notifications

By default, the server analyses each query for all categories and severity of notifications.
Starting from version 5.7, you can use the parameters `notifications_min_severity` and/or `notifications_disabled_categories` to restrict the severity or category of notifications that you are interested into.
You may disable notifications altogether by setting the minimum severity to `OFF`.
You can use those parameters either when creating a `Driver` instance, or when creating a session.

There is a slight performance gain in restricting the amount of notifications the server is allowed to raise.

.Allow only `WARNING` notifications, but not of `HINT` or `GENERIC` category
[source, python]
----
driver = neo4j.GraphDatabase.driver(
    URI, auth=AUTH,
    notifications_min_severity='WARNING',  # or 'OFF' to disable
    notifications_disabled_categories=['HINT', 'GENERIC']
)

# at session level
session = driver.session(
    database="neo4j",
    notifications_min_severity='INFORMATION',
    notifications_disabled_categories=['HINT']
)
