= Installation

To start creating a Neo4j Python application, you first need to install the Python Driver and get a Neo4j database instance to connect to.

[#install-driver]
== Install the driver

Use `pip` to install the link:https://pypi.org/project/neo4j/[Neo4j Python Driver] (requires Python >= 3.7):

[source,bash]
----
pip install neo4j
----

Always use the latest version of the driver, as it will always work both with the previous Neo4j <<LTS>> release and with the current and next major releases.
The latest `5.x` driver supports connection to any Neo4j 5 and 4.4 instance, and will also be compatible with Neo4j 6.
For a detailed list of changes across versions, see the link:https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver/wiki/5.x-changelog[driver's changelog].

[NOTE]
To get the driver on an air-gapped machine, link:https://pypi.org/project/neo4j/#files[download the latest driver] tarball and install it with `pip install neo4j-<version>.tar.gz`.
