.Installation via Install-package
========
To install the latest version of the driver using NuGet in Visual Studio:

[source, csharp, subs="attributes, specialcharacters"]
----
PM> Install-Package Neo4j.Driver
----

It is also an option to install a certain version of the driver.

[source, csharp, subs="attributes, specialcharacters"]
----
PM> Install-Package Neo4j.Driver -Version $DOTNET_DRIVER_VERSION
----

The .Net driver uses asynchronous methods by default.
If you want to use blocking calls, the `Neo4j.Driver.Simple` NuGet package contains a set of extensions.
This can be found at https://www.nuget.org/packages/Neo4j.Driver.Simple/.
The initial examples make use of these extensions.

In the following example we are installing driver version {dotnet-driver-version}.

[source, csharp, subs="attributes, specialcharacters"]
----
PM> Install-Package Neo4j.Driver -Version {dotnet-driver-version}
----
========

The release notes for this driver are available https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-dotnet-driver/releases[here].
