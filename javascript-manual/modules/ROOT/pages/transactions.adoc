= Run your own transactions

When xref:query-simple.adoc[querying the database with `executeQuery()`], the driver automatically creates a _transaction_.
A transaction is a unit of work that is either _committed_ in its entirety or _rolled back_ on failure.
You can include multiple Cypher statements in a single query, as for example when using `MATCH` and `CREATE` in sequence to xref:query-simple#_update_the_database[update the database], but you cannot have multiple queries and interleave some client-logic in between them.

For these more advanced use-cases, the driver provides functions to take full control over the transaction lifecycle.
These are called _managed transactions_, and you can think of them as a way of unwrapping the flow of `execute_query()` and being able to specify its desired behavior in more places.


== Create a session

Before running a transaction, you need to obtain a _session_.
Sessions act as concrete query channels between the driver and the server, and ensure <<causal consistency>> is enforced.

Sessions are created with the method link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/driver.js~Driver.html#instance-method-session[`Driver.session()`].
It takes a single (optional) object parameter, with the property `database` allowing to specify the xref:_database_selection[target database].
For further parameters, see xref:_session_configuration[Session configuration].

[source, javascript]
----
session = driver.session({ database: 'neo4j' })
----

Session creation is a lightweight operation, so sessions can be created and destroyed without significant cost.
Always xref:_close_sessions[close sessions] when you are done with them.

*Sessions are _not_ thread safe*: you can share the main `Driver` object across threads, but make sure each thread creates its own sessions.


[#managed-transactions]
== Run a managed transaction

A transaction can contain any number of queries.
As Neo4j is <<ACID>> compliant, *queries within a transaction will either be executed as a whole or not at all*: you cannot get a part of the transaction succeeding and another failing.
Use transactions to group together related queries which work together to achieve a single _logical_ database operation.

A managed transaction is created with the methods link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/session.js~Session.html#instance-method-executeRead[`Session.executeRead()`] and link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/session.js~Session.html#instance-method-executeWrite[`Session.executeWrite()`], depending on whether you want to _retrieve_ data from the database or _alter_ it.
Both methods take a <<transaction_function>> callback, which is responsible of actually carrying out the queries and processing the result.

[source, javascript]
----
let session = driver.session({ database: 'neo4j' })  // <1>
try {
  let result = await session.executeRead(async tx => { // <2>
    return await tx.run(`  // <3>
      MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.name STARTS WITH $filter
      RETURN p.name AS name ORDER BY name
      `, {filter: 'Al'}
    )
  })
  for(let record in result.records) {  // <4>
    console.log(record.get('name'))
  }
  console.log(
    `The query \`${result.summary.query.text}\`` +
    `returned ${result.records.length} nodes.\n`
  )
} finally {
  session.close()
}
----

<1> Create a session. A single session can be the container for multiple queries. Remember to close it when done.
<2> The `.executeRead()` (or `.executeWrite()`) method is the entry point into a transaction.
<3> Use the method link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/transaction.js~Transaction.html#instance-method-run[`Transaction.run()`] to run queries, providing a Cypher query and an object of query parameters. Each query run returns a link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/result.js~Result.html[`Result`] object.
<4> Process the result records and query summary.

*Do not hardcode or concatenate parameters directly into the query*.
Use xref:query-simple#query-parameters[query parameters] instead, both for performance and security reasons.

*Transaction functions should never return the `Result` object directly*.
Instead, always xref:process-result[process the result] in some way; at minimum, cast it to list.
Within a transaction function, a `return` statement results in the transaction being committed, while the transaction is automatically rolled back if an exception is raised.

[CAUTION]
The methods `.executeRead()` and `.executeWrite()` have replaced `.readTransaction()` and `.writeTransaction()`, which are deprecated in version 5.x and will be removed in version 6.0.

Should a transaction fail for a reason that the driver deems transient, it automatically retries to run the transaction function (with an exponentially increasing delay).
For this reason, *transaction functions should produce the same effect when run several times (_idempotent_)*, because you do not know upfront how many times they are going to be executed.
In practice, this means that you should not edit nor rely on globals, for example.
Note that although transaction functions might be executed multiple times, the queries inside it will always run only once.

A session can chain multiple transactions, but *only one single transaction can be active within a session at any given time*.
This means that a query must be completed before the next one can run, and it is the reason why the previous examples all use the `async/await` syntax.
To maintain multiple concurrent transactions, see xref:query-async.adoc[how to run asynchronous queries].


[#explicit-transactions]
== Run an explicit transaction

You can achieve full control over transactions by manually beginning one with the method link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/session.js~Session.html#instance-method-beginTransaction[`Session.beginTransaction()`].
You run queries inside an explicit transaction with the method link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/transaction.js~Transaction.html#instance-method-run[`Transaction.run()`], as you do in transaction functions.

[source, javascript]
----
let session = driver.session({ database: 'neo4j' })
let transaction = await session.beginTransaction()

// use tx.run() to run queries
//     tx.commit() to commit the transaction
//     tx.rollback() to rollback the transaction

await transaction.commit()
await session.close()
----

An explicit transaction can be committed with link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/transaction.js~Transaction.html#instance-method-commit[`Transaction.commit()`] or rolled back with link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/transaction.js~Transaction.html#instance-method-rollback[`Transaction.rollback()`].
If no explicit action is taken, the driver will automatically roll back the transaction at the end of its lifetime.

Explicit transactions are most useful for applications that need to distribute Cypher execution across multiple functions for the same transaction, or for applications that need to run multiple queries within a single transaction but without the automatic retries provided by managed transactions.

== Session configuration

When creating a session, you can provide an optional parameter of type  link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/driver.js~SessionConfig.html[`SessionConfig`] to specify session configuration values.


=== Database selection

You should *always specify the database explicitly* with the `database` parameter, even on single-database instances.
This allows the driver to work more efficiently, as it saves a network round-trip to the server to resolve the home database.
If no database is given, the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/database-administration/#manage-databases-default[user's home database] set in the Neo4j instance settings is used.

[source, javascript]
----
const session = driver.session({
  database: 'neo4j'
})
----

[TIP]
Specifying the database through the configuration method is preferred over the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/current/clauses/use/[`USE`] Cypher clause.
If the server runs on a cluster, queries with `USE` require server-side routing to be enabled.
Queries may also take longer to execute as they may not reach the right cluster member at the first attempt, and need to be routed to one containing the requested database.


=== Request routing

In a cluster environment, all sessions are opened in write mode, routing them to the leader.
You can change this by explicitly setting the `defaultAccessMode` parameter to either `neo4j.session.READ` or `neo4j.session.WRITE`.
Note that `.executeRead()` and `.executeWrite()` automatically override the session's default access mode.

[source, javascript]
----
const session = driver.session({
  database: 'neo4j',
  defaultAccessMode: neo4j.session.READ
})
----

[#access-control-note]
[NOTE]
====
Although executing a _write_ query in read mode likely results in a runtime error, *you should not rely on this for access control.*
The difference between the two modes is that _read_ transactions are routed to any node of a cluster, whereas _write_ ones are directed to the leader.
In other words, there is no guarantee that a write query submitted in read mode will be rejected.

Similar remarks hold for the `.executeRead()` and `.executeWrite()` methods.
====


[#impersonation]
=== Run queries as a different user (impersonation)

You can execute a query under the security context of a different user with the parameter `impersonatedUser`, specifying the name of the user to impersonate.
For this to work, the user under which the `Driver` was created needs to have the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/dbms-administration/#access-control-dbms-administration-impersonation[appropriate permissions].
Impersonating a user is cheaper than creating a new `Driver` object.

[source, javascript]
----
const session = driver.session({
    database: 'neo4j',
    impersonatedUser: 'somebodyElse'
})
----

When impersonating a user, the query is run within the complete security context of the impersonated user and not the authenticated user (i.e., home database, permissions, etc.).


== Transaction configuration

You can exert further control on transactions by providing a second optional parameter of type link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/typedef/index.html#static-typedef-TransactionConfig[`TransactionConfig`] to `.executeRead()`, `.executeWrite()`, and `.beginTransaction()`.
You can specify:

- A transaction timeout (in milliseconds).
Transactions that run longer will be terminated by the server.
The default value is set on the server side.
The minimum value is one millisecond.
- An object of metadata that gets attached to the transaction.
These metadata get logged in the server `query.log`, and are visible in the output of the `SHOW TRANSACTIONS YIELD *` Cypher command.
Use this to tag transactions.

[source, javascript]
----
let session = driver.session({ database: 'neo4j' })
const people_n = await session.executeRead(
  async tx => { return await tx.run('MATCH (a:Person) RETURN count(a)') },
  { timeout: 5000, metadata: {'app_name': 'people'} }  // TransactionConfig
)
----

== Close sessions

Each connection pool has *a finite number of sessions*, so if you open sessions without ever closing them, your application could run out of them.
It is thus important to always close sessions when you are done with them, so that they can be returned to the connection pool to be later reused.
The best way is to wrap session usage in a `try/finally` block, calling `session.close()` in the `finally` clause.

[source, javascript]
----
let session = driver.session({database: 'neo4j'})
try {
  // use session to run queries
} finally {
  await session.close()
}
