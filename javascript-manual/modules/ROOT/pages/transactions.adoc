= Run your own transactions

When xref:query-simple.adoc[querying the database with `executeQuery()`], the driver automatically creates a _transaction_. A transaction is a unit of work that is either _committed_ in its entirety or _rolled back_ on failure. You can include multiple Cypher statements in a single query, as for example when using `MATCH` and `MERGE` in sequence to xref:query-simple#_update_the_database[update the database], but you cannot have multiple queries and interleave some client-logic in between them.

For these more advanced use-cases, the driver provides functions to take full control over the transaction lifecycle. These are called _managed transactions_, and you can think of them as a way of unwrapping the flow of `executeQuery()` and being able to specify its desired behavior in more places.


== Obtain a session

Before running a transaction, you need to obtain a _session_.
Sessions act as concrete query channels between the driver and the server.
In particular, sessions borrow connections from the _connection pool_ as needed, and ensure <<causal consistency>> is enforced.

Sessions are created with the method link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/driver.js~Driver.html#instance-method-session[`Driver.session()`].
It takes a single (optional) object parameter, with the property `database` allowing to specify the xref:_database_selection[target database].
For further parameters, see xref:_session_configuration[Session configuration].

[source, javascript]
----
session = driver.session({database: 'neo4j'})
----

Session creation is a lightweight operation, so sessions can be created and destroyed without significant cost.
Always xref:_close_sessions[close sessions] when you are done with them.

*Sessions are _not_ thread safe*: you can share the main `Driver` object across threads, but make sure each thread creates its own sessions.


[#managed-transactions]
== Run a managed transaction

A transaction can contain any number of queries.
As Neo4j is <<ACID>> compliant, *queries within a transaction will either be executed as a whole or not at all*: you cannot get a part of the transaction succeeding and another failing.
Use transactions to group together related queries which work together to achieve a single _logical_ database operation.

A managed transaction is created with the methods link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/session.js~Session.html#instance-method-executeRead[`Session.executeRead()`] and link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/session.js~Session.html#instance-method-executeRead[`Session.executeWrite()`], depending on whether you want to _retrieve_ data from the database or _alter_ it.
Both methods take a <<transaction_function>> callback *(1)*, which is responsible of actually carrying out the queries and processing the result.
Queries are specified with the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/transaction.js~Transaction.html#instance-method-run[`Transaction.run()`] method *(2)*, where you provide a Cypher query *(3)* and an object of query parameters *(4)* which returns a link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/result.js~Result.html[`Result`] object.
You can then process the result records and query summary *(5)*.

.Retrieve people whose name starts with `Al`.
[source, javascript]
----
let session, result
session = driver.session({database: 'neo4j'})
result = await session.executeRead(async tx => { // <1>
  return await tx.run(`  // <2>
    MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.name STARTS WITH $filter  // <3>
    RETURN p.name as name ORDER BY name
    `, {filter: 'Al'}  // <4>
  )
})
console.log(
  `The query \`${result.summary.query.text}\`` +
  `returned ${result.records.length} nodes.\n`
)
for(let record in result.records) {  // <5>
  console.log(record.get('name'))
}
----

*Do not hardcode or concatenate parameters directly into the query*.
Use xref:query-simple#query-parameters[query parameters] instead, both for performance and security reasons.

Within a transaction function, a `return` statement results in the transaction being committed, while the transaction is automatically rolled back if an exception is raised.

.A transaction with multiple queries, client logic, and potential roll backs
[source, javascript]
----
const neo4j = require('neo4j-driver');

(async () => {
  const URI = 'neo4j://localhost'
  const USER = 'neo4j'
  const PASSWORD = 'verysecret'
  let driver, session
  let employeeThreshold = 10

  try {
    driver = neo4j.driver(URI, neo4j.auth.basic(USER, PASSWORD))
    await driver.verifyConnectivity()
  } catch(err) {
    console.log(`-- Connection error --\n${err}\n-- Cause --\n${err.cause}`)
    return
  }

  session = driver.session({database: 'neo4j'})
  for(let i=0; i<100; i++) {
    const name = `Neo-${i.toString()}`
    const orgId = await session.executeWrite(async tx => {
      let result, orgInfo

      // Create new Person node with given name, if not already existing
      await tx.run(`
        MERGE (p:Person {name: $name})
        RETURN p.name AS name
        `, { name: name }
      )

      // Obtain most recent organization ID and number of people linked to it
      result = await tx.run(`
        MATCH (o:Organization)
        RETURN o.id AS id, COUNT{(p:Person)-[r:WORKS_FOR]->(o)} AS employeesN
        ORDER BY o.createdDate DESC
        LIMIT 1
      `)
      if(result.records.length > 0) {
        orgInfo = result.records[0]
      }

      if(orgInfo != undefined && orgInfo['employeesN'] == 0) {
        throw new Error('Most recent organization is empty.')
        // Transaction will roll back -> not even Person is created!
      }

      // If org does not have too many employees, add this Person to that
      if(orgInfo != undefined && orgInfo['employeesN'] < employeeThreshold) {
        result = await tx.run(`
          MATCH (o:Organization {id: $orgId})
          MATCH (p:Person {name: $name})
          MERGE (p)-[r:WORKS_FOR]->(o)
          RETURN $orgId AS id
          `, { orgId: orgInfo['id'], name: name }
        )

      // Otherwise, create a new Organization and link Person to it
      } else {
        result = await tx.run(`
          MATCH (p:Person {name: $name})
          CREATE (o:Organization {id: randomuuid(), createdDate: datetime()})
          MERGE (p)-[r:WORKS_FOR]->(o)
          RETURN o.id AS id
          `, { name: name }
        )
      }

      // Return the Organization ID to which the new Person ends up in
      return result.records[0].get('id')
    })
    console.log(`User ${name} added to organization ${orgId}`)
  }
  await session.close()
  await driver.close()
})()
----

Should a transaction fail for a reason that the driver deems transient, it automatically retries to run the transaction function (with an exponentially increasing delay).
For this reason, *transaction functions should produce the same effect when run several times (_idempotent_)*, because you do not know upfront how many times they are going to be executed.
In practice, this means that you should not edit nor rely on globals, for example.
Note that although transaction functions might be executed multiple times, the queries inside it will always run only once.

A session can chain multiple transactions, but *only one single transaction can be active within a session at any given time*.
This means that a query must be completed before the next one can run, and it is the reason why the previous examples all use the `async/await` syntax.
To maintain multiple concurrent transactions, see xref:query-async.adoc[how to run asynchronous queries].


=== Further transaction function configuration

Both `executeRead` and `executeWrite` take a second optional parameter of type link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/typedef/index.html#static-typedef-TransactionConfig[`TransactionConfig`], which allows to supply further configuration parameters.
You can specify:

- a transaction timeout (in milliseconds).
Transactions that run longer will be terminated by the server.
The default value is set on the server side.
- an object of metadata that gets attached to the transaction.
These metadata get logged in the server `query.log`, and are visible in the output of the `SHOW TRANSACTIONS YIELD *` Cypher command.
Use this to tag transactions.

[source, javascript]
----
let session = driver.session({database: 'neo4j'})
const people_n = await session.executeRead(
  async tx => { return await tx.run('MATCH (a:Person) RETURN count(a)') },
  { timeout: 5000, metadata: {'app_name': 'people'} }  // TransactionConfig
)
----


[#explicit-transactions]
== Run an explicit transaction

You can achieve full control over transactions by manually beginning one with the method link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/session.js~Session.html#instance-method-beginTransaction[`Session.beginTransaction()`].
You run queries inside an explicit transaction with the method link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/transaction.js~Transaction.html#instance-method-run[`Transaction.run()`], as you do in transaction functions.

[source, javascript]
----
let session = driver.session({database: 'neo4j'})
let transaction = await session.beginTransaction()

// await transaction.run('<QUERY 1>')
// await transaction.run('<QUERY 2>')
// ...

await transaction.close()
await session.close()
----

The behavior and lifetime of an explicit transaction is controlled through the methods link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/transaction.js~Transaction.html#instance-method-commit[`Transaction.commit()`], link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/transaction.js~Transaction.html#instance-method-rollback[`Transaction.rollback()`], or link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/transaction.js~Transaction.html#instance-method-close[`Transaction.close()`].

Explicit transactions are most useful for applications that need to distribute Cypher execution across multiple functions for the same transaction, or for applications that need to run multiple queries within a single transaction but without the automatic retries provided by managed transactions.

.Example stub with an explicit transaction involving external APIs
[source, javascript]
----
async function transferToOtherBank(driver, customerId, otherBankId, amount) {
  const session = driver.session({database: 'neo4j'})
  const tx = await session.beginTransaction()
  try {
    if(! checkCustomerBalance(tx, customerId, amount))
      return

    try {
      decreaseCustomerBalance(tx, customerId, amount)
      await tx.commit()
    } catch (error) {
      requestInspection(customerId, otherBankId, amount, e)
      throw error  // roll back
    }

    await otherBankTransferApi(customerId, otherBankId, amount)
    // Now the money has been transferred => can't rollback anymore
    // (cannot rollback external services interactions)
  } finally {
    await tx.close()  // rolls back if not yet committed
    await session.close()
  }
}

async function checkCustomerBalance(tx, customerId, amount) {
  result = await tx.run(`
    MATCH (c:Customer {id: $id})
    RETURN c.balance >= $amount AS sufficient
    `, { id: customerId, amount: amount }
  )
  return result.records[0].get('sufficient')
}

async function otherBankTransferApi(customerId, otherBankId, amount) {
  ...
  // make some API call to other bank
}

async function decreaseCustomerBalance(tx, customerId, amount) {
  await tx.run(`
    MATCH (c:Customer {id: $id})
    SET c.balance = c.balance - $amount
    `, { id: customerId, amount: amount }
  )
}

async function requestInspection(customerId, otherBankId, amount, error) {
  // manual cleanup required; log this or similar
  console.log('WARNING: transaction rolled back due to exception:')
  console.log(error)
}
----


== Session configuration

When creating a session, you can provide an optional parameter of type  link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/driver.js~SessionConfig.html[`SessionConfig`] to specify session configuration values.


=== Database selection

You should *always specify the database explicitly* with the `database` parameter, even on single-database instances.
This allows the driver to work more efficiently, as it does not have to resolve the home database first.
If no database is given, the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/manage-databases/introduction#manage-databases-default[user home database] set in the Neo4j instance settings is used.

[source, javascript]
----
const session = driver.session({database: 'neo4j'}
----


=== Request routing

In a cluster environment, all sessions are opened in write mode, routing them to the leader.
You can change this by explicitly setting the `defaultAccessMode` parameter to either `neo4j.session.READ` or `neo4j.session.WRITE`.
Note that `.executeRead()` and `.executeWrite()` automatically override the session's default access mode.

[source, javascript]
----
const session = driver.session({
  database: 'neo4j',
  defaultAccessMode: neo4j.session.READ
})
----

[#access-control-note]
[NOTE]
====
Although executing a _write_ query in read mode likely results in a runtime error, *you should not rely on this for access control.* The difference between the two modes is that _read_ transactions are routed to any node of a cluster, whereas _write_ ones are directed to the leader.
Still, depending on the server version and settings, the server might allow none, some, or all _write_ statements to be executed even in _read_ transactions.

Similar remarks hold for the `.executeRead()` and `.executeWrite()` methods.
====


[#impersonation]
=== Run queries as a different user (impersonation)

You can execute a query under the security context of a different user with the parameter `impersonatedUser`, specifying the name of the user to impersonate.
For this to work, the user under which the `Driver` was created needs to have the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/current/access-control/dbms-administration#access-control-dbms-administration-impersonation[appropriate permissions].
Impersonating a user is cheaper than creating a new `Driver` object.

[source, javascript]
----
const session = driver.session({
    database: 'neo4j',
    impersonatedUser: 'somebodyElse'
})
----

When impersonating a user, the query is run within the complete security context of the impersonated user and not the authenticated user (i.e., home database, permissions, etc.).


== Close sessions

Each connection pool has *a finite number of sessions*, so if you open sessions without ever closing them, your application could run out of them.
It is thus important to be adamant in always closing sessions when you are done with them, so that they can be returned to the connection pool to be later reused.
The best way is to wrap session usage in a `try/finally` block, calling `session.close()` in the `finally` clause.

[source, javascript]
----
let session = driver.session({database: 'neo4j'})
try {
  // use session to run queries
} finally {
  await session.close()
}
----
