= Installation

To start creating a Neo4j JavaScript application, you first need to install the JavaScript Driver and get a Neo4j database instance to connect to.

[#install-driver]
== Install the driver

Use `npm` to install the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/neo4j-driver[Neo4j JavaScript Driver] (requires `npm` and any LTS version of `node.js`):

[source,bash]
----
npm i neo4j-driver
----

Always use the latest version of the driver, as it will always work both with the previous Neo4j <<LTS>> release and with the current and next major releases.
The latest `5.x` driver supports connection to any Neo4j 5 and 4.4 instance, and will also be compatible with Neo4j 6.
For a detailed list of changes across versions, see the link:https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-javascript-driver/wiki/5.0-changelog[driver's changelog].

[NOTE]
--
There is also a link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/neo4j-driver-lite[lite version] of the Neo4j JavaScript Driver, which includes the same features as the regular driver but without support for xref:reactive-sessions.adoc[Reactive sessions].
You can install it with `npm i neo4j-driver-lite`.

== Include the driver

Unless you are going to xref:#[use the driver within a web browser], you use the JavaScript driver in a Node.js application.
To include the driver in your application, use `require`:

[source, javascript]
----
var neo4j = require('neo4j-driver')
----

[NOTE]
--
There are slight differences in how you can use the driver in a Node.js application and in an interactive (REPL) Node.js session.
This is ultimately on Node.js itself, not on the driver.
The examples in the manual are suitable to be run in a REPL session as they are, but you can also copy-paste them in files and run them as scripts.
