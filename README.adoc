== Contents

This repository contains the AsciiDoc and other sources to build the Neo4j Driver Manual.

The examples for each of the driver languages are generated out of each driver's source code repository:

* https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-dotnet-driver[`neo4j-dotnet-driver`]
* https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver[`neo4j-go-driver`]
* https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver[`neo4j-java-driver`]
* https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-javascript-driver[`neo4j-javascript-driver`]
* https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver[`neo4j-python-driver`]


== Usage

The drivers manuals are built using the build tooling in the https://github.com/neo-technology/neo4j-manual-modeling-antora/[neo4j-manual-modeling-antora] repo. Information on how to build drivers manuals locally can be found in the wiki of that repository.
