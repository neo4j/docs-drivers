== Get a Neo4j instance

You need a running Neo4j database in order to use the driver with it.
The easiest way to spin up a *local instance* is through a link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/docker/introduction/[Docker container] (requires `docker.io`).
The command below runs the latest Neo4j version in Docker, setting the admin username to `neo4j` and password to `secretgraph`:

[source,bash]
----
docker run \
   -p7474:7474 \                       # forward port 7474 (HTTP)
   -p7687:7687 \                       # forward port 7687 (Bolt)
   -d \                                # run in background
   -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/secretgraph \   # set login credentials
   neo4j:latest
----

Alternatively, you can obtain a free *cloud instance* through <<Aura>>.
Take a note of the connection URI and of the login credentials.

You can also link:https://neo4j.com/download-center/#community[install Neo4j on your system], or use link:https://neo4j.com/download-center/#desktop[Neo4j Desktop] to create a local development environment (not for production).
