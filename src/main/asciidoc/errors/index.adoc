There are two types of errors that the user of a driver may need to be aware of.
The more likely error to encounter is the Cypher error.
A Cypher error occurs when the server is unable to run the statement that it receives from the driver.

[NOTE]
--
Cypher errors encountered using a Neo4j driver are the same as those that can be encountered anywhere Cypher is used.
This includes the Neo4j Browser, Neo4j Shell, the Cypher REST endpoint, the embedded API, and within a stored procedure.
The Neo4j Manual contains a {neo4j-manual-status-codes}[list of all the Cypher errors].

// The other type of error is protocol error.

// TODO: The list of status codes is broader than Cypher.
//       Will these not be returned by the drivers?
