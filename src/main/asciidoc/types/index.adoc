[abstract]
--
A driver translates between the type system of its language and the type system used in Neo4j.
--

Neo4j has a system of data types for processing and storing data.
Drivers translate between application language types and the Neo4j type system.
To pass parameters and process results, it is important to know the basics of the Neo4j type system and to understand how the Neo4j types are mapped in the driver.

The following Neo4j types are valid both for parameters and results:

* Boolean
* Integer
* Float
* String
* List
* Map

Maps and lists can be processed by the database and used in a statement.
Lists in which the elements share a single primitive Neo4j type can be stored as properties on nodes and relationships.
Maps, and lists in which the elements have mixed types, can not be stored as properties.

In addition to the types valid both for parameters and results, the following Neo4j types are valid for results only:

* Node
* Relationship
* Path

The Neo4j driver maps Neo4j types to native language types as follows:

// TODO: Explain the Node, Relationship and Path types.

.(†) Python versions
****
In Python 2, a Neo4j `Integer` is mapped to `int` and a Neo4j `String` to `str`.
In Python 3 `long` and `unicode` are mapped instead.
