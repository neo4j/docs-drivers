= Data types and mapping to Cypher types

The tables in this section show the mapping between Cypher data types and Java types.

== Core types

[options="header"]
|===
| Cypher Type   | Python Type
| <<NULL>>      | `None`
| `LIST`        | `list`
| `MAP`         | `dict`
| `BOOLEAN`     | `bool`
| `INTEGER`     | `int`
| `FLOAT`       | `float`
| `STRING`      | `str`
| `ByteArray`   | `bytearray`
|===

For full documentation, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/api.html#core-data-types[API documentation -- Core data types].


== Temporal types

Temporal data types are implemented by the `neo4j.time` module.
It provides a set of types compliant with ISO-8601 and Cypher, which are similar to those found in Python's native `datetime` module.
To convert between driver and native types, use the methods `.from_native()` and `.to_native()` (does not apply to `Duration`).

Sub-second values are measured to nanosecond precision and the types are mostly compatible with link:https://pypi.org/project/pytz/[pytz].
Some timezones (e.g., `pytz.utc`) work exclusively with the built-in `datetime.datetime`.

For a list of time zone abbreviations, see link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List[List of tz database time zones].

[options="header"]

| Cypher Type      | Python Type
| `DATE`           | `neo4j.time.Date`
| `ZONED TIME`     | `neo4j.time.Time`†
| `LOCAL TIME`     | `neo4j.time.Time`††
| `ZONED DATETIME` | `neo4j.time.DateTime`†
| `LOCAL DATETIME` | `neo4j.time.DateTime`††
| `DURATION`       | `neo4j.time.Duration`

=== `Date`

Represents an instant capturing the date, but not the time, nor the timezone.

[source, python]
----
from neo4j.time import Date

d = Date(year=2021, month=11, day=2)
print(d)  # '2021-11-02'
----

For full documentation, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/types/temporal.html#date[API documentation -- Temporal data types -- Date].


=== `Time`

Represents an instant capturing the time, and the timezone offset in seconds, but not the date.

[source, python]
----
from neo4j.time import Time
import pytz

t = Time(hour=7, minute=47, nanosecond=4123, tzinfo=pytz.FixedOffset(-240))
print(t)  # '07:47:00.000004123-04:00'
----

For full documentation, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/types/temporal.html#time[API documentation -- Temporal data types -- Time].


=== `LocalTime`

Represents an instant capturing the time of day, but not the date, nor the timezone.

[source, python]
----
from neo4j.time import Time

t = Time(hour=7, minute=47, nanosecond=4123)
print(t)  # '07:47:00.000004123'
----

For full documentation, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/types/temporal.html#time[API documentation -- Temporal data types -- Time].


=== `DateTime`

Represents an instant capturing the date, the time, and the timezone identifier.

[source, python]
----
from neo4j.time import DateTime
import pytz

dt = DateTime(year=2021, month=11, day=2, hour=7, minute=47, nanosecond=4123)

=== `LocalDateTime`

Represents an instant capturing the date and the time, but not the timezone.

[source, python]
----
from neo4j.time import DateTime

dt = DateTime(year=2021, month=11, day=2, hour=7, minute=47, nanosecond=4123)

----

For full documentation, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/types/temporal.html#datetime[API documentation -- Temporal data types -- DateTime].


=== `Duration`

Represents the difference between two points in time.
A `datetime.timedelta` object passed as a parameter will always be implicitly converted to `neo4j.time.Duration`.
It is not possible to convert from `neo4j.time.Duration` to `datetime.timedelta` (because `datetime.timedelta` lacks month support).

[source, python]
----
from neo4j.time import Duration

duration = Duration(years=1, days=2, seconds=3, nanoseconds=4)
print(duration)  # 'P1Y2DT3.000000004S'
----

For full documentation, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/types/temporal.html#duration[API documentation -- Temporal data types -- Duration].


== Spatial types

Cypher supports spatial values (points), and Neo4j can store these point values as properties on nodes and relationships.

The object attribute `srid` (short for _Spatial Reference Identifier_) is a number identifying the coordinate system the spatial type is to be interpreted in.
You can think of it as a unique identifier for each spatial type.

[options="header"]
|===
| Cypher Type         | Python Type
| `POINT`             | `neo4j.spatial.Point`
| `POINT (Cartesian)` | `neo4j.spatial.CartesianPoint`
| `POINT (WGS-84)`    | `neo4j.spatial.WGS84Point`
|===

For full documentation, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/types/spatial.html[API documentation -- Spatial types].

=== `CartesianPoint`

Represents a point in 2D/3D Cartesian space. +
Exposes properties `x`, `y`, `z` (the latter for 3D points only).

[source, python]
----
from neo4j.spatial import CartesianPoint

# A 2D CartesianPoint
point = CartesianPoint((1.23, 4.56))
print(point.x, point.y, point.srid)
# 1.23 4.56 7203

# A 3D CartesianPoint
point = CartesianPoint((1.23, 4.56, 7.89))
print(point.x, point.y, point.z, point.srid)
# 1.23 4.56 7.8 9157
----

For full documentation, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/types/spatial.html#cartesianpoint[API documentation -- Spatial types -- CartesianPoint].

=== `WGS84Point`

Represents a point in the World Geodetic System (WGS84). +
Exposes properties `longitude`, `latitude`, `height` (the latter for 3D points only), which are aliases for `x`, `y`, `z`.

[source, python]
----
from neo4j.spatial import WGS84Point

# A 2D WGS84Point
point = WGS84Point((1.23, 4.56))
print(point.longitude, point.latitude, point.srid)
# or print(point.x, point.y, point.srid)
# 1.23 4.56 4326

# A 3D WGS84Point
point = WGS84Point((1.23, 4.56, 7.89))
print(point.longitude, point.latitude, point.height, point.srid)
# or print(point.x, point.y, point.z, point.srid)

== Graph types

*Graph types are only passed as results and may not be used as parameters*.
The section Manipulate query results -- Transform to graph contains an example with graph types.

[options="header"]
|===
| Cypher Type    | Python Type
| `NODE`         | `neo4j.graph.Node`
| `RELATIONSHIP` | `neo4j.graph.Relationship`
| `PATH`         | `neo4j.graph.Path`
|===

For full documentation, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/api.html#graph-data-types[API documentation -- Graph types].


=== `Node`
Represents a node in a graph. +
The property `element_id` provides an identifier for the entity.
This should be used with care, as no guarantees are given about the mapping between id values and elements outside the scope of a single transaction. In other words, using an `element_id` to `MATCH` an element across different transactions is risky.

[source, python]
----
from neo4j import GraphDatabase


URI = "<URI for Neo4j database>"
AUTH = ("<Username>", "<Password>")

with GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH) as driver:
    records, _, _ = driver.execute_query(
        "MERGE (p:Person {name: $name}) RETURN p AS person",
        name="Alice",
        database_="neo4j",
    )
    for record in records:
        node = record["person"]
        print(f"Node ID: {node.element_id}\n"
              f"Labels: {node.labels}\n"
              f"Properties: {node.items()}\n"
        )

# Node ID: 4:73e9a61b-b501-476d-ad6f-8d7edf459251:0
# Labels: frozenset({'Person'})
# Properties: dict_items([('name', 'Alice')])
----

For full documentation, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/api.html#neo4j.graph.Node[API documentation -- Graph types -- Node].


=== `Relationship`

Represents a relationship in a graph. +
The property `element_id` provides an identifier for the entity.
This should be used with care, as no guarantees are given about the mapping between id values and elements outside the scope of a single transaction.

[source, python]
----
from neo4j import GraphDatabase


URI = "<URI for Neo4j database>"
AUTH = ("<Username>", "<Password>")

with GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH) as driver:
    records, _, _ = driver.execute_query("""
        MERGE (p:Person {name: $name})
        MERGE (p)-[r:KNOWS {status: $status, since: date()}]->(friend:Person {name: $friend_name})
        RETURN r AS friendship
        """, name="Alice", status="BFF", friend_name="Bob",
    )
    for record in records:
        relationship = record["friendship"]
        print(f"Relationship ID: {relationship.element_id}\n"
              f"Start node: {relationship.start_node}\n"
              f"End node: {relationship.end_node}\n"
              f"Type: {relationship.type}\n"
              f"Friends since: {relationship.get('since')}\n"
              f"All properties: {relationship.items()}\n"
        )

# Relationship ID: 5:73e9a61b-b501-476d-ad6f-8d7edf459251:1
# Start node: <Node element_id='4:73e9a61b-b501-476d-ad6f-8d7edf459251:0' labels=frozenset({'Person'}) properties={'name': 'Alice'}>
# End node: <Node element_id='4:73e9a61b-b501-476d-ad6f-8d7edf459251:2' labels=frozenset({'Person'}) properties={'name': 'Bob'}>
# Type: KNOWS
# Friends since: 2022-11-07
# All properties: dict_items([('since', neo4j.time.Date(2022, 11, 7)), ('status', 'BFF')])
----

For full documentation, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/api.html#neo4j.graph.Relationship[API documentation -- Graph types -- Relationship].


=== `Path`

Represents a path in a graph.

[source, python]
----
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
from neo4j.time import Date


URI = "<URI for Neo4j database>"
AUTH = ("<Username>", "<Password>")

def add_friend(driver, name, status, date, friend_name):
    driver.execute_query("""
        MERGE (p:Person {name: $name})
        MERGE (p)-[r:KNOWS {status: $status, since: $date}]->(friend:Person {name: $friend_name})
        """, name=name, status=status, date=date, friend_name=friend_name,
        database_="neo4j",
    )

with GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH) as driver:
    # Create some :Person nodes linked by :KNOWS relationships
    add_friend(driver, name="Alice", status="BFF", date=Date.today(), friend_name="Bob")
    add_friend(driver, name="Bob", status="Fiends", date=Date.today(), friend_name="Sofia")
    add_friend(driver, name="Sofia", status="Acquaintances", date=Date.today(), friend_name="Sofia")

    # Follow :KNOWS relationships outgoing from Alice three times, return as path
    records, _, _ = driver.execute_query("""
        MATCH path=(:Person {name: $name})-[:KNOWS*3]->(:Person)
        RETURN path AS friendship_chain
        """, name="Alice",
        database_="neo4j",
    )
    path = records[0]["friendship_chain"]

    print("-- Path breakdown --")
    for friendship in path:
        print("{name} is friends with {friend} ({status})".format(
            name=friendship.start_node.get("name"),
            friend=friendship.end_node.get("name"),
            status=friendship.get("status"),
        ))

----

For full documentation, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/api.html#neo4j.graph.Path[API documentation -- Graph types -- Path].


== Extended types

The driver supports more types as query parameters, which get automatically mapped to one of the xref:_core_types[core types]. Because of this conversion, and because the server does not know anything about the extended types, the driver will never return these types in results, but always their corresponding mapping.

[options="header"]
|===
| Parameter Type     | Mapped Python Type
| tuple              | `list`
| bytearray          | `bytes`
| numpy `ndarray`    | `list` (nested)
| pandas `DataFrame` | `dict`
| pandas `Series`    | `list`
| pandas `Array`     | `list`
|===


In general, if you are unsure about the type conversion that would happen on a given parameter, you can test it as in the following example:

[source, python]
----
import neo4j

with neo4j.GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH) as driver:
    type_in = ("foo", "bar")
    records, _, _ = driver.execute_query("RETURN $x AS type_out", x=type_in)
    type_out = records[0].get("type_out")
    print(type(type_out))  # <class 'list'>
    print(type_out)        # ['foo', 'bar']
----


== Exceptions

The driver can raise a number of different exceptions.
A full list is available in the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/api/python-driver/current/api.html#errors[API documentation].
For a list of errors the server can return, see the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/status-codes/{page-version}[Status code] page.

.Root exception types
[options="header", cols="<25m,<75a"]
|===
| Classification    | Description
|Neo4jError         | Errors reported by the Neo4j server (e.g., wrong Cypher syntax, bad connection, wrong credentials, ...)

|DriverError        | Errors reported by the driver (e.g., bad usage of parameters or transactions, improper handling of results, ...)
|===

Some server errors are marked as safe to retry without need to alter the original request.
Examples of such errors are deadlocks and memory issues.
All driver's exception types implement the method `.is_retryable()`, which gives insights into whether a further attempt might be successful.
This is particular useful when running queries in xref:transactions#explicit-transactions[explicit transactions], to know if a failed query should be run again.
